This is an official project done in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the course
Oriented Projects (CS F376) under Dr Ayan Das's supervision and guidance.

<br /><br />India is a multilingual society with 1369 rationalized languages and dialects being spoken across
the country (INDIA, 2011)[1]. Despite this, today&#39;s state-of-the-art multilingual systems perform
suboptimally on Indian (IN) languages. This can be explained by the fact that multilingual language
models (LMs)[3] are often trained on 100+ languages together, leading to a small representation
of IN languages in their vocabulary and training data. Multilingual LMs are substantially less
effective in resource-lean scenarios (Wu and Dredze, 2020; Lauscher et al., 2020), as limited data
doesn&#39;t help capture the various nuances of a language. This phenomenon is not adequately
handled by current state-of-the-art multilingual LMs. To address the aforementioned gaps, we use
MuRIL, a multilingual LM specifically built for IN languages.
